Convolutional Neural Net for Identifying Traditional Tagalog Baybayin Characters

This model is a small personal project designed to bring attention to pre-colonial
filipino culture. There is little practical purpose for machines to identify characters
in a largely unsued/dead script, but hopefully a project like this can shed light toward
the erasure of filipino and Southeast Asian culture.

The model was trained on 400+ b/w 16x16 images of various baybayin characters. All
characters were written by filipinos such as myself and close friends and relatives.

Resolution and color were kept limited to ensure very few input parameters. This
allowed the project to be trained on a relatively small dataset. I plan on producing
more model for various underepresented languages around the world, provided I find people
qualified to replicate them. I also plan a higher resolution version, once I can compile
enough images to make it feasible. 

Models such as this are extremely time intensive. They require lots of data collection
and are difficult to do on a large scale. If you would like to contribute to a project
like this or feel have ideas for futures projects please reach out.
