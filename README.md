 Machine Learning Model for Identifying Traditional Tagalog Baybayin Characters

This model is a small personal project to designed to bring attention to precolonial
pilipino culture. It serves little practical purpose for machine to identify a characters
in a largely unsued script, but hopefully a project like this can shed light toward
the erasure of pilipino and Southeast Asian culture.

The model was trained on 400+ b/w 16x16 images of various baybayin characters. All
characters were written by filipinos such as myself and close friends and relatives.

Resolution and color were kept limited to ensure very few input parameters. This
allowed the project to be trained on a relatively small datasets. I plan on producing
more model for various underepresented scripts around the world, provided I find people
qualified to replicate them. I also plan a higher resolution version, once I can compile
enough images to make it feasible.
